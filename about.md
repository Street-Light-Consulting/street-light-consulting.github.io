    <p>I started Street Light Consulting because I couldn’t find a firm that viewed business through the lens of faith. Too many organizations are losing their way — chasing metrics while missing meaning. I’ve seen workplaces where systems crush people instead of lifting them, where hiring is broken, and where good leaders burn out trying to fix what culture forgot.</p>
    <p>Street Light was born on my trip to Rome out of hope — the belief that business can be a force for renewal. My mission is to help teams rediscover purpose, strengthen trust, and return to the kind of leadership that listens. Because when leaders choose light over noise, they don’t just build stronger companies — they help restore faith in the system itself.</p>

## Our Philosophy
Street Light Consulting was founded on a simple conviction: that organizations thrive when they care for the people within them. We believe that sustainable growth comes from spiritual, emotional, and operational health working in harmony. 

Our work invites leaders to see business as more than performance metrics — it’s an act of stewardship. When people grow, the organization grows. When integrity is restored, momentum returns. And when faith leads, clarity follows.

## Our Approach
We partner with leaders and teams to bring clarity to systems, structure to vision, and peace to the process. Our consulting engagements are deeply personal and highly practical — designed to uncover the root issues that block growth and replace them with actionable, values-driven systems.

Each engagement begins with understanding the people behind the process. From there, we align strategy, accountability, and culture to build organizations that run efficiently *and* lead compassionately. Our goal is to leave every client with renewed focus, a healthier rhythm, and confidence that their systems reflect their values.

## Our Values
- **Integrity:** We believe in honesty, transparency, and consistency — even when no one is watching.  
- **Stewardship:** Every organization is entrusted with people and purpose. We help leaders manage both faithfully.  
- **Renewal:** Growth comes from reflection, humility, and courage to change.  
- **Excellence:** We pursue quality not as perfectionism, but as care — doing good work because it serves others well.  
- **Faith:** Our work is grounded in God’s truth and guided by prayer. We place purpose above profit and people before process.
