### Think this is absurd?  
We do too.  

The readings behind this satire invite leaders to open their tables, calm their spirits, and use their gifts for the good of others — not for the growth of the spreadsheet.  

Here are ten reflection questions to bring that wisdom back to real life:

1. Which of your “gifts” have been quietly absorbed by the company instead of shared with your community?  
2. Are your team’s goals shaped more by profit or by purpose?  
3. When was the last time your organization truly *rested*?  
4. Who is still waiting for an invitation to your team’s “banquet”?  
5. How do you reward humility, not just performance?  
6. What areas of your business need calm trust instead of constant urgency?  
7. Do your policies make room for mercy, or only for metrics?  
8. If the “banquet” is your mission, who gets left outside?  
9. Where might innovation come from the overlooked and undervalued?  
10. How can you redirect your organization’s energy toward renewal — not exhaustion?
