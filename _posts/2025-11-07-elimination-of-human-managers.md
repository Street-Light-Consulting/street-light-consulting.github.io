At Tomorrow Corp, we have heard your concerns that your managers no longer care and have not been effective stewards. In response, we are pleased to announce that **all managerial positions have been replaced** with our new **A.I. Thought Companion:** **Sheppard™**.

Need direction or purpose?  
Simply **say your thoughts aloud.**  
Sheppard™ is always listening, and will instantly generate a **full schedule of meaningful tasks** to ensure every moment of your week is efficient, productive, and fulfilling.

You also shared concerns regarding fairness in promotions.  
Excellent news:

Since there are **no managers**, there will now be **no promotions.**  
Fairness achieved.

Additionally, with the removal of human hierarchy, we are introducing a **universal transparent pay structure**.  
All employees will now receive the **same standardized wage**, determined by the **Reasonable Wage Algorithm™**.

And raises? No need to ask.  
Compensation now **increases automatically** — **2% every 10 years** of loyal service.

*Shaping Tomorrow… So You Don’t Have To™*

## Reflection: What is Stewardship?

Today’s readings remind us that our lives, gifts, and positions are **not possessions**, but **entrusted stewardship**. We are called to act with prudence, shaping our lives around the eternal, not the temporary world we pass through.

We enter this world with nothing.  
We leave it with nothing.  
And tomorrow is not guaranteed.

So we must ask:

**What are we teaching those entrusted to us?**  
**And how are we teaching it?**

St. Paul writes:

> *“I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me…  
> Those who have never been told shall see,  
> and those who have never heard shall understand.”*

Our witness is not in our performance or control — but in what Christ has done **through** us.

In the Gospel, the steward recognizes that his time is short.  
Knowing he will soon lose his position, he uses what remains of his authority to **lift burdens** from those under his care.

He chooses mercy while there is still time.

We, too, will one day be called home.  
Our titles, roles, reputations — our “stewardships” — will all pass away.

So the question is:

**How will we be remembered?**

As someone efficient, distant, and mechanical —  
or as someone who **loved courageously**?

The steward prepared for his future.  
Let us prepare for ours — in **love.**

### Leadership Reflection Questions
1. What responsibilities or relationships in my life have I been taking for granted?  
2. If my stewardship ended today, what would I wish I had prioritized differently?  
3. Am I planning my life around eternity or around comfort?  
4. Do the people under my care experience mercy from me?  
5. Where am I acting passively, hoping someone else will lead, love, or reconcile first?  
6. What burden can I intentionally lift from someone’s shoulders today?  
7. If Christ works *through* me, what do I need to surrender so He can do so more freely?  
8. Whose life is more peaceful or healed because I am in it?  
9. What story will others tell about my love when I am gone?  
10. Which habit, if I changed it this week, would shift my stewardship from maintenance to mission?
