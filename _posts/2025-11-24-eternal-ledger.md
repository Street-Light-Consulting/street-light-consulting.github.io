# What Does Accounting Have to Do with Jesus?

The purpose of accounting is to provide an “account” or record for the activities of a business or an organization. Firm spending is accounted for by recording these activities as a debit or a credit. The rules of accounting are such that for every debit there is also a credit. In other words, the debits and credits must **balance** one another out.

Finally, accountants check the ledger for errors when they perform what is called a **reconciliation** with the bank statements.

The ultimate reason for this department is to guard the firm’s treasure, which is **money**. Without ***money**, the firm ceases to exist.

The purpose of Jesus, on the other hand, is to help us **account for the activities of our life**. The rules are the commandments of the Bible. When we are following these rules, there is **peace and harmony**; there is a **balance**. When we are not following the rules, there is chaos and conflict.

When things don’t add up or don’t make sense, we can **reconcile** our hearts to His with confession and repentance.

The ultimate reason for Jesus is to guard society’s greatest treasure, which is **Love**.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Re-centering on love**  
   What would your organization look like if you put true love (the love of God and of one another) at the center instead of the love of money and efficiency?

2. **Read Luke 16**

   a. Assume Jesus is the rich man and you are His steward.  

   Are you showing the love of Christ with your team, or are you squandering the opportunity?

   b. What is “dishonest wealth”? 
   Why is it guaranteed to fail?  
   If it is guaranteed to fail, why do you put so much trust in it?

   c. Assume your wealth failed. Who would still be there for you?  
   Who would welcome you in and still call you their friend?

   Without sounding morbid or inducing fear: How are you preparing for it all to fail?
