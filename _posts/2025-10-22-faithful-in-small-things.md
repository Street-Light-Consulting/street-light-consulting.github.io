### Living Ready

In business and leadership, we spend a lot of time trying to anticipate what’s next — the market shift, the client’s decision, the next quarter.  
But in today’s readings, Jesus turns that instinct inward. He asks us to prepare our **hearts**, not our spreadsheets.  

Saint Paul reminds us that freedom doesn’t come from doing whatever we want, but from doing what’s right:  
> “You were once slaves to sin, but now obedient from the heart.”  
True freedom, in leadership and in life, comes when we align our will with God’s.  

This is the quiet art of stewardship — managing what has been entrusted to us, not as owners, but as caretakers.

### 10 Reflection Questions for Leaders

1. **Romans 6:12-18 — “Do not let sin reign in your mortal body.”**  
   What small, tolerated habits might be dimming the light in your organization — overwork, pride, gossip, or control?

2. **“You were once slaves to sin, but now obedient from the heart.”**  
   How can you help your team move from *compliance* (doing what’s required) to *conviction* (serving from purpose)?

3. **“Freed from sin, enslaved to righteousness.”**  
   Do your company’s policies and culture promote moral discipline — showing that structure can create true freedom?

4. **Psalm 124 — “Our help is in the name of the Lord.”**  
   Where have you seen God quietly sustain your business, project, or team through unseen help?

5. **“Had not the Lord been with us...”**  
   What moments of near failure revealed His protection or mercy over your work?

6. **Luke 12:39-48 — “If the master had known the hour...”**  
   What rhythms or systems could you build to increase vigilance — so your organization is prepared before crisis strikes?

7. **“Much will be required of the person entrusted with much.”**  
   How can you turn your authority into stewardship — using resources, time, and influence for the flourishing of others?

8. **“Be ready, for the Son of Man is coming...”**  
   How can you model readiness — not through fear or perfectionism, but through calm faith and consistent excellence?

9. **Romans 6 + Luke 12 — Integrating readiness and righteousness.**  
   How can prayer, ethical review, or reflection time become part of your internal control system — guarding both mission and morale?

10. **Legacy and Accountability.**  
    When the “Master returns,” what will He find in your leadership legacy — people who grew under your care, or just an organization that survived?

### A Leader’s Prayer

> Lord, help me lead with vigilance and humility.  
> Remind me that every decision, every word, and every system reveals who I serve.  
> Keep my heart awake, my team joyful, and my leadership pure.  
> May I never forget that much has been entrusted to me — and much will be required.  
> Amen.

**Street Light Reflection:**  
Faithful leadership doesn’t start with plans or profits.  
It begins in the heart — where readiness becomes service, and stewardship becomes joy.
