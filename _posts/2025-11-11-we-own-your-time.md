### **Reminder: We Own All of Your Time and Talent!**

At **Tomorrow Corp**, we kindly remind you that by choosing to work here, you have joyfully surrendered all of your **time**, **treasure**, and **talents** for the greater good of corporate efficiency.

While we encourage “outside hobbies,” any attempt to **monetize your creativity** will be immediately recognized as a **conflict of interest** and graciously **seized for Tomorrow Corp’s continued success and profit.**

Remember our motto:  
**Tomorrow Corp — What’s Yours Is Ours Forever™.**

## **What Is Forever?**

Well, we know what it isn’t: **this world.** Despite our best efforts, we will all eventually die. Christians call this *Memento Mori* — “remember you must die.”

Today’s readings remind us that death isn’t final for those who hope for eternal life:

> “For if before men, indeed, they be punished,  
> yet is their hope full of immortality;  
> Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,  
> because God tried them and found them worthy of himself.”  
> *(Wisdom 3:4–5)*

So if you are being persecuted in this life, take heart! It says right here to hope in immortality despite the trials that await you in this present world.  
In other words: **if you don’t fear death and punishment in this world, you have already found eternal life.**

What rules are you following—the rules of the eternal Kingdom of God, or the rules of the very temporary **H.R. department** at your very temporary job?

## **Is Profit the Ultimate Goal?**

In today’s Gospel, Jesus calls us *unprofitable servants*:

> “When you have done all you have been commanded, say,  
> ‘We are unprofitable servants;  
> we have done what we were obliged to do.’”  
> *(Luke 17:10)*

So—did we serve the right Master today?
