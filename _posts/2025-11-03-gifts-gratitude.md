When a leader accepts that their role and the organization’s opportunities are gifts, it changes how control, humility and stewardship are handled. Instead of “what I’ve built,” the question becomes “what am I stewarding for?”

### Cultivating Gratitude & Humility  
The Psalm reminds us that even the “lowly” are seen and valued. In a business context, it’s about acknowledging the quiet contributions, the overlooked roles, the hidden costs. Gratitude becomes a discipline.

### Inviting the Underserved into the Growth Story  
Jesus’s teaching about inviting those who cannot repay challenges our usual ROI-driven mindset. For organizations, inviting the underserved, the outside‑network, the marginalized into your banquet isn’t just charity—it’s strategic renewal. Inclusion becomes innovation.

### Satirical Reflection: “The Generosity Department”  
Our mid‑century satire piece this week, *The Generosity Department*, imagines a 1950s corporation proudly managing empathy through a giant lever labeled **“ACTIVATE COMPASSION!”**—because sometimes, even good intentions get industrialized.  
> “Because empathy should always be centrally managed.”  

The humor reminds us that authentic generosity cannot be automated or scheduled. True renewal happens when grace exceeds the system.

**Today’s readings (Romans 11:29‑36; Psalm 69:30‑31,33‑34,36; Luke 14:12‑14)** invite us to think about leadership not just as strategy or execution—but as a posture of gratitude, generosity, and inclusion.

### 10 Reflection Questions for Leaders  
1. What talents or opportunities in my organization am I relying on as if they were earned wholly by my own effort, rather than received as a gift?  
2. How does our team culture encourage gratitude — especially toward those who work behind the scenes, or who may feel unseen?  
3. In what ways does our organization “invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind” — metaphorically speaking — meaning those who are often excluded from our business ecosystem?  
4. Where am I tempted to treat relationships purely as transactions (invite those who will repay) rather than as invitations rooted in generosity?  
5. How might recognizing the “irreversible gifts” we have been given transform the way we plan strategy, allocate resources, or deploy talent?  
6. What systems or processes in our business marginalize people or stakeholders — and how might we redesign them to bring in those voices?  
7. How do we celebrate success and express thanks in a way that honors that much of what we achieve is dependent on generosity, support, and shared effort?  
8. Is there an area of our organization where we assume we have “it sorted” and so neglect humility, listening or renewal?  
9. How would our business change if we measured success not only by profit or efficiency, but by how many people we included and uplifted who previously were beyond our reach?  
10. How can I, as a leader, commit to making one concrete decision this week that invites someone who cannot repay us into our circle of growth?

**At Street Light Consulting**, we believe that organizational renewal begins when leadership aligns vision with generosity and inclusion. Today’s reading encourages us: lead with an open banquet, invite those who cannot repay, and let growth become more than business—it becomes community.
