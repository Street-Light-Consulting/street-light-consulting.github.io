**Subject:** Managerial Infallibility Policy Update  

At **Tomorrow Corp**, we remind all associates that **your managers are always 100% right — even when they’re 100% wrong.**  

We understand this may be difficult to comprehend for those not yet elevated to management. But take heart! After **15 years of loyal service**, and a **perfect attendance record** (including skipping all family emergencies), *you too* may one day qualify to be almost wrong — but still right.  

According to **Tomorrow Corp’s Single Source of Truth™**, the **Employee Handbook**, your **purpose** is clear:  

> You exist to serve your manager and their generous bonus structure.  

If your manager is wrong, they **lose their bonus.**  
If *you* are wrong, you **lose your job.**  

**Fairness Achieved.™**  
**Tomorrow Corp — Leadership That’s Always Right.**

## What Is Divine Leadership?  

The Book of Wisdom reminds us that as managers, we don’t just report to shareholders and the handbook:  

> *“Hearken, you who are in power over the multitude  
> and lord it over throngs of peoples!  
> Because authority was given you by the Lord  
> and sovereignty by the Most High.”*  

And if we chase only profits and not God’s will, the results reach beyond performance reviews:  

> *“Because, though you were ministers of his kingdom, you judged not rightly,  
> nor walked according to the will of God.  
> Terribly and swiftly shall he come against you.”*  

Therefore—with great power—comes great responsibility:  

> *“For the lowly may be pardoned out of mercy,  
> but the mighty shall be mightily put to the test.”*  

In today’s Gospel, Jesus heals ten people, yet only one returns to thank Him—an outsider.  
Are you returning to Jesus to thank Him for the blessings in your life, or are you running away?

## 💭 Reflection Questions  

1. When was the last time you thanked your “manager,” and was it actually God you meant to thank?  
2. Do you measure success by divine standards or quarterly reports?  
3. If you were promoted to “infallible,” would your halo fit comfortably—or choke you a little?  
4. Have you ever defended a bad decision just because it came from the top?  
5. What would your performance review look like if written by the Holy Spirit?  
6. How often do you trade truth for compliance?  
7. Are you mentoring others toward integrity, or just teaching them how to survive the meeting?  
8. When the handbook and the Gospel disagree, which do you quote first?  
9. Do you thank God for your influence, or do you assume it’s self-earned?  
10. If Jesus walked into your next staff meeting, would He find humility—or a new policy update?
