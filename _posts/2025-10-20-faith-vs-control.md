Jesus’ parable of the rich fool (Luke 12:13-21) reminds us that **wealth doesn’t mean security**.  
The man’s barns were full, but his soul was empty. True wealth isn’t stored in accounts — it’s measured in how we serve.  
To be *“rich toward God”* is to let every plan, meeting, and transaction reflect generosity rather than greed.

At Street Light Consulting, we call this **day-at-a-time planning** — leading with faith today rather than chasing control tomorrow.  
If you were called home tonight, would your team be able to say they served God well today?

That’s where **internal controls** come in.  
In business, they protect assets; in faith, they guard hearts. Biblical stewardship asks us to build systems that prevent greed from taking root — policies rooted in trust, not fear.

Leaders often confuse excellence with over-control.  
But faith in leadership means believing that the people God sent you are capable of carrying the mission forward.  
The healthiest organizations are not micromanaged — they are *trusted*.

Finally, remember the real treasure: **the gifts you give** — the gift of clarity, encouragement, and service.  
In the end, God measures not the barns we build but the lives we brighten.

> **Reflection:** Are your plans building bigger barns — or stronger people?
