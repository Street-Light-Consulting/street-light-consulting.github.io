**Tomorrow Corp — Building Trust Through Total Transparency™**

## **Reflection — “Total Control or Total Trust?”**

> *“Why then do you judge your brother or sister?  
> Or you, why do you look down on your brother or sister?  
> For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.”*  
> — Romans 14 : 10

Today’s first reading reminds us that leadership begins with humility.  
Are you operating your company from a position of **trust** — or a position of **total control**?

> *“I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.”*  
> — Psalm 27 : 13

Trust brings life to a company. Control drains it.

> *“The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,  
> but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,  
> ‘This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.’”*  
> — Luke 15 : 1-2

Are you expecting your staff to be perfect — or are you regularly walking among them, eating with them, coaching them, and helping them grow spiritually?

> *“There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents  
> than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.”*  
> — Luke 15 : 7

How many of your employees have experienced **spiritual renewal** because they have worked with your team — and for your company?

Don’t be so focused on *Tomorrow Corp* that you lose sight of **Today**.

**Think this is absurd?**  
We do too.  
*Definitely not based on today’s readings: Romans 14 : 10, Psalm 27 : 13, and Luke 15 : 1-7.*

### **Reflection Questions**

1. Where in your leadership does control disguise itself as “excellence”?  
2. How do you invite grace into your daily management decisions?  
3. Are you listening to your employees, or just monitoring them?  
4. What does spiritual renewal look like in your workplace?  
5. How can humility build trust in your organization?  
6. When was the last time you dined with your staff — not as their boss, but as their companion?  
7. What systems in your company serve fear instead of faith?  
8. How might your policies look if written with mercy in mind?  
9. Which employees have grown spiritually because of your presence?  
10. Are you leading for heaven’s joy — or tomorrow’s report?
