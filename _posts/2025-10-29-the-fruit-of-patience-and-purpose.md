### The Reading in Brief  
**Romans 8:1-11, Psalm 24, and Luke 13:1-9**

Paul reminds us that *“there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”* The Spirit brings life where control once ruled. In Luke, the parable of the fig tree calls us to patience—growth takes time, but neglect bears no fruit. Psalm 24 anchors us back to stewardship: everything we manage belongs to God.

These readings are an invitation to lead with grace, clarity, and accountability.

### 10 Questions for Leaders  

1. **Freedom from Condemnation:**  
   In your organization, are people working from fear of failure or from the freedom to grow and improve?  

2. **Spirit vs. Flesh:**  
   What “old ways” of thinking—control, greed, ego—still dominate your company culture, and how could the Spirit of renewal replace them?  

3. **Healthy Roots:**  
   The fig tree was given more time to bear fruit. Who in your organization needs a little more care and patience rather than immediate judgment?  

4. **Repentance in Practice:**  
   What internal habits or policies should be “pruned” to help your team flourish in fairness and purpose?  

5. **Ownership and Stewardship:**  
   Psalm 24 reminds us the earth is the Lord’s. How does your company show stewardship over its resources, people, and impact?  

6. **Breath of Life:**  
   Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit bringing life to what was dead. What part of your mission feels lifeless and could use revival?  

7. **Measurement of Fruit:**  
   Are you measuring success by profit alone, or by the fruit your organization bears in people’s lives?  

8. **Patience and Accountability:**  
   How do you balance giving people time to grow with holding them accountable for results?  

9. **Inner Renewal:**  
   What part of your leadership style could shift from controlling outcomes to trusting God’s timing?  

10. **Corporate Repentance:**  
   If your business stood before God as the fig tree, would it be found fruitful—or just busy?

### Reflection  
Fruitfulness is not about speed—it’s about rootedness.  
In the rush of goals and deadlines, the true work of leadership is cultivating soil where others can grow.
