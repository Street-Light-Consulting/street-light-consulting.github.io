## How to Set Realistic Goals for Your Sales Team Using Market Share

Let’s say you sell new construction homes and last month, the market you operate in sold **100 new construction homes**. Your team sold **10 of them**, representing a **10% market share**.

Historically, your company has operated between **10–15% market share**, so this result is well within your normal performance range.

Now let’s look ahead.

## Start With Last Year’s Data

Looking at the same month last year, your company sold **20 homes**, which also represented a **10% market share**.

That tells us something important:

> **If 20 homes were 10% of the market, then the total market last year was 200 homes.**

**The math:**

```
20 homes ÷ 0.10 = 200 total homes sold
```

## Adjust for Market Conditions

You expect the market to be about **20% slower** than last year due to broader conditions—interest rates, buyer hesitation, or reduced inventory.

So instead of 200 total homes, you project:

```
200 homes × 0.80 = 160 total homes this year
```

## Set a Realistic Market Share Target

You believe internal conditions have improved—better systems, stronger coaching, clearer process, or a more competitive product. Because of this, the team can comfortably operate at a **12% market share**, even in a slower market.

Translate that into a sales goal:

```
160 total homes × 0.12 = 19.2 homes
```

Rounded, that’s **19–20 homes** for the month.

## Why This Approach Works

Instead of guessing or simply “adding growth,” this method:

- Anchors goals in **real market data**
- Accounts for **external conditions**, not just internal ambition
- Builds **credibility and buy-in** with the sales team
- Separates **market decline** from **sales execution**

If your team sells 19–20 homes in this scenario, they didn’t “miss last year’s number”—they **outperformed the market**.

## The Leadership Insight

Good sales goals aren’t about optimism or pressure.  
They’re about **context**.

When leaders measure performance using market share instead of raw volume:

- Accountability increases  
- Excuses decrease  
- Coaching gets sharper  
- Performance discussions become factual, not emotional  

**Market share turns goal-setting into leadership—not wishful thinking.**
