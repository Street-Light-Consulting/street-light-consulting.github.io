Tired of your paycheck feeling a little… light?

We hear you! And we’re proud to announce that after allocating 97% of our compensation budget to executive bonuses, we have finally uncovered a bold, innovative, absolutely-not-legally-binding solution for the rest of you:

Introducing: Tomorrow Coin

The digital-ish, crypto-ish, value-adjacent currency exclusively for Tomorrow Corp employees!

“Because Who Needs Real Money, Anyway?”

Tomorrow Coin works just like real money—except for the minor detail that it becomes instantly worthless the moment you exit Tomorrow Corp property. But who leaves campus anymore, right?

Use Tomorrow Coin Anywhere on Campus!

Spend it on exciting, life-enriching essentials like:

Meals in our employee cafeteria (now with smaller, healthier portions!)

Your required Tomorrow Corp uniform (dry cleaning is extra but can also be purchased with tomorrow coin!)

Premium Parking Experience™ : Self park your car in our fully air conditioned parking garage!

Tomorrow Corp Health Insurance*.

Please note that tomorrow corporate insurance requires you to use the campus medical facilities--especially for any workplace accidents. All actual procedures cost a very high deductible paid for in real money only.

Tomorrow Corp Rental Housing--because everyone wants to rent a tiny home! Right?

Please note maintenance is not included and costs real world money. 

At Tomorrow Corp, we pay you—so you can pay only us!

# Biblical Relection 

And while Tomorrow Corp works tirelessly to invent new forms of imaginary wealth, today’s readings remind us what real treasure looks like—the kind that can’t be printed, minted, devalued, or restricted to corporate property lines.

“Come now, be the first to obey the king’s command,as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah and those who are left in Jerusalem have done."

"Then you and your sons shall be numbered among the King’s Friends, and shall be enriched with silver and gold and many gifts.”

# Workplace Relection

Do you follow orders that you know to be unethical just to gain riches or favor at work?

The Bible warns us against bowing down to earthly desires while ignoring the will of God:

“God forbid that we should forsake the law and the commandments. We will not obey the words of the king nor depart from our religion in the slightest degree.”

Is the fear of living in the desert of unemployment vs the comfort of employment causing you to stay in an unethical environment?

The bible shows us that righteous people actually chose to live in the desert rather than to violate God's will. 

“Many who sought to live according to righteousness and religious custom went out into the desert to settle there.”

# Summary

Now ask yourself: What would your life look like if you intentionally chose not to live on Tomorrow Corp’s overly controlled, luxurious campus?

What would you do with this new kind of freedom?
