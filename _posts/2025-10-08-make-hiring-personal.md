Recruiting should never begin with a résumé — it should begin with a **conversation**.  

Before reviewing applications or scoring skills, meet the person. Listen. Learn their story.  
A real conversation often reveals far more about potential, character, and alignment than any automated system ever could.

When someone applies, they’re extending trust. The least a company can do is return that trust through thoughtful follow-up — even if the answer is *no*. Offer feedback, direction, and encouragement for what’s next. Every interaction should leave the person better than they arrived.

**Relationships are the foundation of every great organization.** Scripture reminds us:  

> “Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.” — *Ecclesiastes 4:9*  

Hiring is not a transaction — it’s a relationship.  
The goal isn’t just to fill a seat; it’s to build a community of people who grow, support, and strengthen one another.

When we choose connection over convenience, we honor both our mission and the people called to help fulfill it.
