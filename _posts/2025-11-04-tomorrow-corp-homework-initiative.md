Tomorrow Corp is proud to announce its latest productivity breakthrough: **The Homework Initiative** — because your spiritual gifts should be fully optimized for maximum output.

Executives explain that many employees were wasting valuable creativity on “family,” “service,” and “rest.” In a bold act of synergy, Tomorrow Corp has found a way to bring work *home* — ensuring that every ounce of divine inspiration can now serve a measurable KPI.

> “We realized that people were using their gifts outside of office hours,” said an enthusiastic HR director, “and that just didn’t align with our vision of holistic productivity.”  

Under the new program, employees are invited to take their laptops, project binders, and mild anxiety home each evening. Families are encouraged to participate through *Team Alignment Activities* such as collaborative spreadsheeting and bedtime budget reviews. Even the dog can now serve as an Emotional Support Consultant.

According to internal policy updates, all employee time now officially belongs to Tomorrow Corp — including evenings, weekends, and moments previously reserved for prayer or community service.  
> “While we appreciate personal convictions,” an HR memo reads, “we ask that all spiritual gifts be directed toward corporate synergy objectives. Unauthorized acts of kindness, service, or worship outside of work channels may be considered a conflict of interest and should be reported to your HR Representative immediately.”

The campaign poster cheerfully declares:  
> “Work doesn’t stop at the office anymore — now you can bring it home! Yes, our regular 9-to-5 remains mandatory, but thanks to this exciting new program, you can enjoy the satisfaction of working even more!”

In a stunning act of self-awareness, the program’s internal memo concludes:  
> “Remember folks: Work is the most essential thing in your life.”  

Observers note that this announcement follows the same ancient model of invitation described somewhere long before PowerPoint — a call to humility, calm trust, and inclusion. But Tomorrow Corp insists that any resemblance is purely coincidental.

*Romans 12:5–16ab*, *Psalm 131*, and *Luke 14:15–24.*

### Think this is absurd?  
We do too.  

The readings behind this satire invite leaders to open their tables, calm their spirits, and use their gifts for the good of others — not for the growth of the spreadsheet.  

Here are ten reflection questions to bring that wisdom back to real life:

1. Which of your “gifts” have been quietly absorbed by the company instead of shared with your community?  
2. Are your team’s goals shaped more by profit or by purpose?  
3. When was the last time your organization truly *rested*?  
4. Who is still waiting for an invitation to your team’s “banquet”?  
5. How do you reward humility, not just performance?  
6. What areas of your business need calm trust instead of constant urgency?  
7. Do your policies make room for mercy, or only for metrics?  
8. If the “banquet” is your mission, who gets left outside?  
9. Where might innovation come from the overlooked and undervalued?  
10. How can you redirect your organization’s energy toward renewal — not exhaustion?
