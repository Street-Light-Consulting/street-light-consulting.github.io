excerpt: "Good Governance is not only the right way to operate, it is also biblical."

> **“Plans succeed with counsel, but without guidance, people fall.”** — Proverbs 20:18  
> **“Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.”** — Proverbs 11:14  
> **“The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways.”** — Proverbs 14:8  

No business or organization should ever be run in isolation. Sustainable organizations are built with accountability, wisdom, and shared responsibility.

A healthy organization includes six essential elements:

## 1. A Board of Trusted Governance Advisors

Every organization should maintain a circle of **independent, trusted advisors**—ideally formal board members—who bring deep operational expertise in areas critical to the organization’s long-term viability and success.

At a minimum, this should include:
- A **licensed CPA**
- A **licensed attorney**
- A trusted expert who deeply understands **technology and systems**

Most importantly, every advisor must **understand and adhere to a strict ethical code of conduct**. Governance without ethics is risk, not protection.

## 2. Third-Party Oversight

To properly protect assets, organizations must establish **independent third-party oversight**, particularly in **accounting and IT**. Internal teams should never be the sole validators of their own work.

Regular audits and external reviews:
- Verify accuracy and integrity
- Ensure compliance
- Protect core organizational assets
- Build trust with stakeholders

Oversight is not a sign of distrust—it is a sign of maturity.

## 3. A Healthy Respect for Rules-Based Order

Governance meetings and decision-making processes must operate under **clearly defined rules** that apply equally to all members. No individual should ever operate outside of those rules.

Strong organizations are built on:
- Consistent governance procedures
- Enforced accountability
- Shared responsibility for integrity

When rules are respected, trust grows. When rules are ignored, organizations fracture.

## 4. Clear Separation of Authority and Duties

No single individual should control **decision-making, execution, and verification** in the same area.

Best practice requires:
- Segregation of financial duties
- Defined approval thresholds
- Clear documentation of who can decide, who executes, and who reviews

This protects both the organization **and** the individuals serving it. Concentrated authority invites risk—even when intentions are good.

## 5. Formal Documentation and Institutional Memory

Healthy organizations do not rely on oral tradition or “everyone remembers.”

This includes:
- Written bylaws and charters
- Documented votes and meeting minutes
- Retained contracts and policies
- Clear onboarding for new board members

Organizations outlast people. Institutional memory must live on paper, not personalities.

## 6. Keep the Mission Simple

Complexity is not wisdom. Overcomplicating the mission creates confusion, slows decision-making, and weakens accountability.

Healthy organizations:
- Clearly articulate their mission in plain language
- Avoid unnecessary layers, committees, and processes
- Regularly test decisions against the core mission

Simplicity protects focus. Focus protects impact.
