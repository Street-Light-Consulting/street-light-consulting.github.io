### The Fading Light

Modern leadership is filled with habits that quietly dim the light of others—overworking, greed, and the desire to control every outcome.  
These are not signs of strength but warnings that the inner flame may be fading.  

When Jesus said *“Gird your loins and light your lamps,”* He wasn’t calling for more hustle.  
He was calling for **spiritual readiness**—for leaders whose hearts are awake and whose light lifts others.

### The Company’s Torch

Every organization has a torch — its shared spirit and sense of purpose.  
A leader’s role is not to carry that flame alone but to help the team gather around it,  
protect it from the winds of fear and greed,  
and let each person take their turn keeping it bright.  

When the torch burns strong, the team sees clearly.  
When it’s neglected, darkness quickly fills the gaps with gossip, worry, and exhaustion.  
Our job as leaders is to **tend the fire**.

### Readiness of the Heart

True readiness isn’t logistical—it’s spiritual.  
Are the people God placed in your care being lifted up?  
Do they experience joy in their work?  
Or are they living for material comfort and momentary pleasure?

The question for every leader is simple:  
**Is your team ready for the return of Jesus—or just ready for Friday?**  
Joy, humility, and peace are the signs of a heart prepared for His arrival.

### The Lamp: Radiant, Contagious Joy

The lamp in this passage represents **joy that spreads**—a radiant, contagious glow that draws people to its source.  
In today’s workplace, keeping your lamp lit means nurturing a positive culture and refusing to let negativity take root.  
It means letting your joy become the quiet sermon that others can see even when you never speak a word.

When others witness calm, purpose-filled leadership in chaotic times, they begin to sense something divine—and they want to know the source.

### Servant Leadership: The Master Who Serves

Jesus flips the script of leadership in this Gospel.  
He says that when the master returns and finds his servants ready,  
*He Himself will serve them.*

That’s the model for today’s leader: **be last, not first.**  
Lift others. Share credit. Listen deeply.  
When a CEO picks up the broom or a manager pauses to pray for their team, they’re lighting the torch of the whole company.  
The culture warms because humility gives off heat.

### Guarding the Light: Internal Controls of the Spirit

At Street Light Consulting, we talk often about clarity and internal controls—  
not as paperwork, but as **spiritual disciplines** that protect a team’s joy.  

A concise plan.  
Honest dialogue.  
Clear accountability.  

These are the rails that keep the flame upright.  
When everyone knows the mission and trusts each other’s intentions, drama fades and the company’s torch shines brighter.

### Practice: Daily Stand-Up Renewal

Start tomorrow with a daily rhythm of renewal.  
Gather your team at the beginning and end of each day—  
not just to review tasks but to **reconnect hearts**.  

Offer a short prayer.  
Share one thing you’re grateful for.  
Address problems face-to-face before they grow.  

These simple acts will do more to light the torch of your organization  
than any new system or meeting ever could.

### Closing Reflection and Prayer

> “Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant.”  
> — *Luke 12:37*

Lord, help us keep our lamps burning bright.  
Teach us to guard the torch of our teams with humility and grace.  
Protect us from greed and control, and renew in us the joy that draws others to You.  
May our workplaces become beacons of readiness and radiant faith.  

**Today, light the torch.**  
Lift someone up.  
And let your leadership glow with the warmth of Christ’s love.
